Why You Should Not Use Arch
==========
A new user's guide to highly personalized, low maitenance operating system.

Arch is a very good Linux distribution so it is not a surprise that it has gained a lot of users in the last couple of years. That being said it seems to me like there are a lot of people installing Arch for the wrong reasons, choosing this distro for features that are not unique to Arch and ignoring some that are detrimental to how they are going to use it. I'm writing this guide to clear up a lot of common misconceptions about Arch while walking the reader through setting up Ubuntu in a highly personalized, possibly lightweight and simple way.
